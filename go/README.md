# PR Checker AI ðŸ’š - Go

An intelligent pull request review tool that leverages both OpenAI and Anthropic AI models to provide comprehensive code reviews directly on your GitHub pull requests.

## Features

- **Dual AI Analysis**: Get reviews from both OpenAI GPT-5 and Anthropic Claude 4 Sonnet models for comprehensive feedback
- **Automated PR Comments**: Automatically posts review results as comments on your GitHub pull requests
- **GitHub CLI Integration**: Uses GitHub CLI for seamless PR interaction

## Prerequisites

Before using PR Checker AI, ensure you have:

1. **GitHub CLI (`gh`)** installed and authenticated
2. **OpenAI API Key** - Set as `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable
3. **Anthropic API Key** - Set as `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable

## Installation

1. Download the executable from the latest release on the [releases page](https://github.com/AstraBert/pr-checker-ai/releases), save it as `pr-checker-cli` and then test it with:

```bash
./pr-checker-cli --help
```

2. Set up your API keys:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-anthropic-api-key"
```

3. Ensure GitHub CLI is authenticated:

```bash
gh auth login
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Review a pull request using the `check` command and the `-p`, `--pr` flag:

```bash
./pr-checker-cli check -p 123
```

## How It Works

1. **Fetches PR Details**: Uses GitHub CLI to collect general PR information and diff changes
2. **AI Analysis**: Sends PR details to both OpenAI and Anthropic models for review, in parallel
3. **Posts Comment**: Creates a formatted comment on the PR with both reviews
4. **Console Output**: Returns the link to the comment, as well as informs you of the progress through logs.

## Output Format

The tool generates a structured comment on your PR containing:

- **OpenAI Review**: Analysis from the specified OpenAI model
- **Anthropic Review**: Analysis from the specified Anthropic model
- **Approval Status**: Each AI provides an approve/not approve recommendation
- **Automated Footer**: Indicates the comment was generated by PR Checker AI
